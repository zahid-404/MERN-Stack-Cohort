This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning the MERN stack through an 8-10 week course led by Harkirat Singh. During this course, I will be actively contributing to open-source projects and expanding my knowledge in the world of web development.

## Course Overview

The course, guided by Harkirat Singh, is divided into four main parts:

### 1. Understanding the MERN Stack

In this initial phase, I will delve into the fundamentals and basics of the MERN stack, which comprises MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

### 2. Transitioning to TypeScript

A major milestone in the course involves transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript. This transition ensures that the code I write is safer, more maintainable, and free from common JavaScript-related pitfalls.

### 3. Embracing Monorepos

I'll explore how real-world applications are structured, including how code is shared between the frontend and backend. This knowledge is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications.

### 4. Open Source Contributions

The most exciting part of this course involves contributing to a significant open-source project. The project has raised over $10 million, boasts substantial activity on its GitHub repository, and functions as a real business. I'll be breaking down this project into smaller subsets and actively contributing to them independently. My journey will culminate in making meaningful contributions to the main project.
